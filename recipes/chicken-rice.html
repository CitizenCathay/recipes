        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken rice is a South East Asian dish with Chinese and Malay influences.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hainanese rice mix</li>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Parseley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion.</li>
            <li>After it’s cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the chicken from drying out.</li>
